DodgeBlawk
======

DodgeBlawk is a arcade styled game that was a pet project of a friend and I. It is essentially a survival game where
you have to avoid/destroy magnetic asteroids to survive the oncoming storm. Your ship however is slightly damaged so
when you fire your weapons your hull takes damage but don't worry the asteroids for some reason contain powerups/repair kits.
They do however contain depowerup kits so becarfeul what you pick up.
